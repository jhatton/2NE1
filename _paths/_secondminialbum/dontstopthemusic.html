					This is fun<br/>
					The finest cuisine for you<br/>
					Move here and there<br/>
					Let me hear your voice
					</p>
					<p>[Dara]<br/>
					(Fiore) In this music, we Fiore<br/>
					(Fiore) We're dangerous like thorns on a red rose<br/>
					(Fiore) Leave yourself to this rhythm
					</p>
					<p>[Cl]<br/> (Fiore) In this place, it's just music and you</p>
					
					<p>[Bom] <br/>
					After this music comes to an end<br/>
					I know that I can't see you again<br/>
					So dj, turn the music up with more excitement<br/>
					In order to forget everything in this moment
					</p>
					<p>Everybody hands up high<br/>
					(Oh) Put them up together<br/>
					We're ready to get crazy, everyone get together<br/>
					Rock, rock, rock, keep running
					</p>
					<p>[Minji] <br/>
					Let's become one, become one<br/>
					So that everyone is all rowdy<br/>
					Let's become one, become one<br/>
					Until this club crashes completely
					</p>
					<p>[Dara]<br/> 
					(Fiore) In this music, we Fiore<br/>
					(Fiore) We're dangerous like thorns on a red rose<br/>
					(Fiore) Match the beat, match all the steps
