The finest cuisine for you
Move here and there
Let me hear your voice

(Fiore) Leave yourself to this rhythm
[Cl] (Fiore) In this place, it's just music and you

I know that I can't see you again
So dj, turn the music up with more excitement
In order to forget everything in this moment

So that everyone is all rowdy
Let's become one, become one
Until this club crashes completely

Is right now, this music makes me high

So dj, turn the music up with more excitement
In order to forget everything in this moment
