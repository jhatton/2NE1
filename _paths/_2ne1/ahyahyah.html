            <p>Break it down now<br/>
                Break it down now<br/>
                Break it down now<br/>
                This how it's goin' down<br/>
            </p>

            <p>[Minzy]</p>
            <p> You say you love me but why<br/>
                Do you keep making it so hard for me?<br/>
                What is it exactly that you're upset about<br/>
                Recently your increased interference<br/>
                and meddling is wearing me out<br/>
            </p>

            <p>[CL]</p> 
            <p>Hey, like that, I've been avoiding<br/>
                Your phone calls for the past few days again<br/>
                I tell you what's going on<br/>
                Your promise to make only me happy, boy<br/>
                Tell me what's up, what's up, you've changed a lot<br/>
            </p>

            <p>[Dara]</p> 
            <p>You're trying to overcome this easily<br/>
                But it seems our time's already up,<br/>
                Time to say good bye, don't pretend like you can't hear me<br/>
                We were over a long time ago, now turn your head away<br/>
                I'm singing a break-up song, bye my love<br/>
            </p>

            <p>[Minzy]</p> 
            <p>I'm going to fly higher to that far away place<br/>
                I'm not going to be fooled anymore by sweet temptations<br/>
                It's a new start, now it's time to part ways<br/>
                Once again, I'm boldly making my exit<br/>
            </p>

            <p>[Bom]</p> 
            <p>So as expected from you, I hope that you'll<br/>
                Be free from me forever, this moment right now<br/>
                Love is always ouch and always comes with pain<br/>
                I will forget you now<br/>
            </p>

            <p>[CL]</p> 
            <p>Sighs that naturally come out in the middle of our increased arguments<br/>
                We're doing wrong to each other, and you know this too, that I'm better without you<br/>
                Whenever we fight our repetitive, guilty fights, we always try to win against the other<br/>
                I hate myself when I'm like this and so I hate you more, I'm trying to erase you now<br/>
            </p>

            <p>[Dara]</p> 
            <p>Please think of farewell as love as well<br/>
                You'd drive me crazy<br/>
                Being like this, I don't think I can help but hate you<br/>
                Instead I'll tell you, it's over, now turn your head away<br/>
                I'm singing a breakup song, goodbye my love<br/>
            </p>

            <p>Wherever I go, I will think of you<br/>
                You're always next to me, always by my side<br/></p>
            <p>[Bom]</p> 
            <p>I'll pray for you, bring my two hands together<br/>
                That you're happy, and that we're forever forever forever together<br/></p>
